This About Me project covers some of the cool things I learned in my IMDX class. It's a website I built entirely with HTML and CSS, putting together various concepts to create a personal online space.

## Project Overview

This website includes several sections to give visitors a glimpse into who I am:

* **Bio:** A brief introduction about myself and my aspirations, particularly in cybersecurity.
* **Hobbies:** A list detailing my various interests, from gaming and exploring to fashion and working with computers.
* **Photo Gallery:** A place to display some personal photos.
* **Video:** Embedding a short video.
* **Mini-Blog/Article:** A section where I wrote about a topic I learned – specifically, a simple look at CSS Animation.
* **Contact Me:** A form for visitors to get in touch.

## Cool Things I Learned and Implemented

Building this project allowed me to practice and implement several key web development concepts learned in class:

* **HTML Structure:** Organizing content using semantic HTML5 tags to create a well-structured page.
* **CSS Styling and Layout:**
    * Applying custom styles using CSS to control the visual appearance, including fonts (like Nokora and Playfair Display), colors, and spacing.
    * Using different CSS layout techniques:
        * **Flexbox:** Implemented for the responsive navigation bar (`nav.css`).
        * **CSS Grid:** Used for arranging the photo gallery section on larger screens (`style.css`).
    * **Responsive Design:** Making the website adapt to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile) using `@media` queries in both `style.css` and `nav.css`.
    * **CSS Animations and Transitions:**
        * Creating hover effects on images in the gallery to add visual interest and interactivity (`style.css`).
        * Implementing more advanced CSS animations, like the subtle bounce and rainbow color effect on the "More About CSS ANIMATION" link (`style.css`).
* **Embedding Media:** Incorporating images and videos into the webpage.
* **Creating Forms:** Building a functional contact form to allow visitors to send messages.
* **CSS Concepts Demonstrated in Blog:** Writing an article (`#lit` section) to explain CSS Animation showcases my understanding of this concept.

The color scheme, using grey, green, and a touch of purple (seen in elements like the first letter styling in the blog post), was intentionally chosen. Grey provides a neutral, calming base, allowing the green and purple to stand out and highlight key elements without overwhelming the design.

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the webpage.
* `style.css`: Contains the primary CSS rules for styling the different sections and elements.
* `nav.css`: Contains the CSS specifically for the navigation bar, focusing on its layout and responsiveness.
