                <h2>More about Me</h2>

                <div>
                  <p>Hello there. I’m Anthonie Jones, a college freshman studying information systems and technology who loves finding creative ways to solve problems and share what I learn along the way. Growing up not far from Jersey but always feeling a little out of place, I’ve spent most of my time exploring new hobbies, building small projects on my computer, and dreaming of a career in cybersecurity. This blog post is a quick snapshot of who I am right now, what I care about, and where I’m headed. Think of it as a window into my world as I put the finishing touches on my portfolio site.</p>

                  <p>From the time I was a kid, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work under the hood. Whether it was taking apart an old radio or tweaking settings on our family computer, I was drawn to puzzles and hidden layers of systems. That curiosity led me to experiment with simple HTML pages in middle school, then to dabble in CSS and basic scripting. By high school, I was hooked on the blend of logic and creativity that programming offers. I still remember building my first “Hello World” page and feeling a real spark when it displayed exactly how I coded it.</p>
                  
                  <p>When I arrived at college, I dove headfirst into courses on networking, database management, and basic security principles. Each class has given me a toolkit I’m eager to expand. Learning about firewalls, encryption algorithms, and secure code practices has convinced me even more that cybersecurity is where I belong. Right now I’m working on several certifications, like CompTIA Security Plus, to back up my practical experience with formal credentials. I believe that balancing practical experience with recognized qualifications will make me a stronger candidate when I start looking for internships and my first full time role.</p>
                  
                  <p>Outside of class and certifications, you’ll often find me gaming online with friends, scouting out new coffee shops around town, or experimenting with fashion and DIY crafts at home. I love using small projects like building a custom desk organizer with a 3D printer or styling outfits that blend techwear with street style to keep my creativity flowing. On weekends I dive into open world games or hit the trails for a change of pace. These hobbies keep me balanced and remind me that curiosity doesn’t have to be reserved for code.</p>
                  
                  <p>I’m also a big believer in sharing knowledge. That’s why I spend time writing tutorials on my site, recording short clips explaining basic networking concepts, or walking friends through how to set up two factor authentication step by step. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing someone else light up when they grasp a tricky idea for the first time. Teaching keeps me sharp and helps me appreciate how far I’ve come since my first shaky steps in front of a command line.</p>
                  
                  <p>Looking ahead, I’m focused on polishing this About Me project into something I can proudly showcase to employers and peers. I want this space to reflect not only my technical skills but also the personality and curiosity that drive me. I’ll be refining my logo, adding articles on topics like CSS sprites and image hover effects, and making sure the site is responsive and accessible on every device. In the meantime, thanks for reading this little introduction. Stick around for more posts where I dive into practical tutorials, share lessons from my own mistakes, and explore the ever evolving world of technology alongside you.</p>
