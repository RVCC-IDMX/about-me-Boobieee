        <article id="lit">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>When I first started designing websites, all of my designs looked flat. I saw other websites that had
              things moving and
              looked more alive, and I wanted the same. That was when I started looking into CSS animations.
            </p>

            <p>First, I thought that I needed to know JavaScript to animate things. But when I read the CSS-Tricks
              animation page,
              I learned that CSS can do a lot by itself. It went over the basics like how animations work and how you
              can control
              the duration and when they start. I liked the ease it appeared to have.
            </p>

            <p>I kept going and found the MDN documentation for CSS animation. It was more detailed, but it made me
              understand how it all works together.
              I learned what each part is used for, like how you set up an animation and declare how long it takes to
              run. It did not seem hard anymore after
              I saw how the code was organized and what each line represented.
            </p>

            <p>Then there was a Stack Overflow question about a rainbow animation.
              That one interested me because it was a neat idea. I did not know you could do such things with CSS alone.
              It really opened my eyes to how creative you could get.
              You could probably do more than just simple fade effects.

              Once I got the hang of it, I started experimenting with my own ideas. I incorporated simple animations
              into buttons and images to make my site a bit more dynamic.
              I did not go overboard, but it made a difference. Even subtle motion catches the eye and makes the page
              more interesting.
            </p>

            <p>Animations aren't necessarily visual. They can be utilized to guide individuals through your site. If
              something fades in or slides in, it garners attention.
              It can help individuals notice what's important. But it is easy to overdo it. I learned to keep it smooth
              and not throw movement around. Too much and it is nothing more than a distraction.

              The best thing is that it's simple to get started. I worked through those three sites to learn the basics
              and experiment with some things. I did not need any other software.
              Typing and experimenting with a few lines of CSS was enough.</p>

            <p>If you are a newbie, simply select one simple animation and try it. Once you see it in action, you will
              want to do more. It does make a site feel different. It took my pages from boring to something alive.

              That is how I began with CSS animations. Just baby steps, one idea at a time, and implementing what I had
              learned from those tutorials.</p>
